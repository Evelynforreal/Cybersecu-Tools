 Cybersecu-Tools
 
I am interested in becoming a cybersecurity analyst. I am university graduate of business
management and google cybersecurity certificate with a brand range of technical skills
and passion for learning and development. I have great skils of problem solving by using 
splunk to identify and respond to security threats like compromised credentals, spot
an insider threat before they cause your organization harm.

I am interested in cybersecurity with less than a year of experience helping organizations
to identity threat actor and protects against external and internal threats. I believe my vulunteer
and internship will make me a candidate and will help me develop more professional skills.

As a security professional with less than a year of experience gained through internships and volunteering,
I am committed to maintaining the highest levels of information security. My knowledge of security techniques 
such as network security, access control, and incident response enables me to detect and mitigate possible 
risks, assuring the safety of vital data and systems. I am devoted to protecting confidentiality, complying 
with all security standards, and consistently enhancing security policies to protect the organization's assets.

My name is Evelyn. I am committed to protect people's security and financial well-being. I enjoy working
with technology and analyzing solving complex problems.
